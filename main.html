	 <h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity refers to how the computation time of an algorithm increases with the size of the input. 
        An algorithm with better <b>time complexity</b> is considered more efficient.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> measures how much memory an algorithm uses as the input size grows. 
        For example, an algorithm that requires additional memory proportional to the input may have a space complexity of O(n).
