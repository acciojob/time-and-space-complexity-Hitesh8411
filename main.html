		    <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity refers to how the running time of an algorithm changes as the input size increases. 
        A lower time complexity indicates that an algorithm is more efficient.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> measures the total amount of memory required by an algorithm to execute completely. 
        For example, an algorithm may have a Space Complexity of O(n).
